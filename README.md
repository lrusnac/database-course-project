# database course project

This project was developed by [Leonid Rusnac](https://github.com/lrusnac) and [Italo Guerrieri](https://github.com/italo3600) at university for the database course. It is a dynamic website written in php for the management of a multiplex cinema. The main goal of this project is to study postgresql, develop a efficient database, and study php. The website has also the authentication system, that allowed us to drop some skills about computer security.

The online version of the project is [here](http://bd.bedifferent.me).
